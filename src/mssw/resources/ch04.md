# Chapter 4

## Question 1
Given the Performance interface in Example 4-25, add a method called getAllMusicians that returns a Stream of the artists performing and, in the case of groups, any musicians who are members of those groups. For example, if getMusicians returns The Beatles, then you should return The Beatles along with Lennon, McCartney, and so on.

```java
/** A Performance by some musicians - e.g., an Album or Gig. */
public interface Performance {

    public String getName();

    public Stream<Artist> getMusicians();

}
```

## Question 2

Based on the resolution rules described earlier, can you ever override equals or hashCode in a default method?

> No because Object is a concrete class and will always win.

## Question 3

Take a look at the Artists domain class in Example 4-26, which represents a group of artists. Your assignment is to refactor the getArtist method in order to return an Optional<Artist>. It contains an element if the index is within range and is an empty Optional otherwise. Remember that you also need to refactor the getArtistName method, and it should retain the same behavior.

```java
public class Artists {

    private List<Artist> artists;

    public Artists(List<Artist> artists) {
        this.artists = artists;
    }

    public Artist getArtist(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= artists.size()) {
            indexException(index);
        }
        return artists.get(index);
    }

    private void indexException(int index) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(index +
                                           " doesn't correspond to an Artist");
    }

    public String getArtistName(int index) {
        try {
            Artist artist = getArtist(index);
            return artist.getName();
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            return "unknown";
        }
    }

}
```
