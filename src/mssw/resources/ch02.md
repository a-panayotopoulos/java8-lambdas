# Chapter 2

## Question 1

1. Can you draw this functional interface diagrammatically?
```
          #############
  T t --> ##  apply  ## --> R r
          #############
```

1. What kind of lambda expressions might you use this functional interface for
if you were writing a software calculator?
> Pass in an expression, producing a resulting value.

1. Which of these lambda expressions are valid `Function<Long,Long>`
implementations?
> Only the first one: `x -> x + 1;`

## Question 2

1. Find the method in Javadoc or using your IDE.
> Found it. `public static <S> ThreadLocal<S> withInitial(Supplier<? extends S>
 supplier) {`

1. The Java DateFormatter class isn’t thread-safe. Use the constructor to
create a thread-safe DateFormatter instance that prints dates like this:
“01-Jan-1970”.
>See
[ThreadLocalDateFormat.java](src/mssw/java/com/lambdaherding/edi/mssw/ch02/ThreadLocalDateFormatter.java)
 and run [Main.java](src/mssw/java/com/lambdaherding/edi/mssw/ch02/Main.java)

## Question 3

1. `Runnable helloWorld = () -> System.out.println("hello world");`
> Yes as it can see you are assigning a closure to a Runnable type.

1. The lambda expression being used as an ActionListener:
```java
  JButton button = new JButton();
  button.addActionListener(event ->
    System.out.println(event.getActionCommand()));
```
> Yes as buttons only have one method for addActionListener and so there is only
 one method to match this signature

1. Would `check(x -> x > 5)` be inferred, given the following overloads for
 check?
```java
  interface IntPred {
      boolean test(Integer value);
  }

  boolean check(Predicate<Integer> predicate);

  boolean check(IntPred predicate);
```
> No because there are two things that take integers as a parameter and perform
 a function on them.
